<p>As a human being you are capable of <strong>thoughts</strong>, <strong>words</strong> and <strong>actions</strong>.</p>

<p>We also feel <strong>emotions</strong>.</p>

<p>If we harm someone with our thoughts, words and actions then their emotional reactions will be stored and returned to us later.</p>

  <dt>How to dissolve the karmic effects?</dt>
  <dd>The Law of Grace (The Path of Forgiveness)</dd>
</dl>

<p>Open your heart and truly feel into the person we have hurt and imagine the hurt and loss the other person has felt as deeply and as stronly as you can.</p>

<p>Make sure that the strong feelings of remorse are stored in your body.</p>

<p>Go to the person and ask for forgiveness and offer to make ammends.</p>

<p>Only when the other person has truly and fully forgiven us and accepted our offer of ammends will it be possible that the karma is dissolved.</p>
